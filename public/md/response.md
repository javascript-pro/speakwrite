Charles. There is nothing wrong with me. My father, Charles, is a perfect case study and example of the initial acceptance of a dementia diagnosis, followed by the relentless change to an apparent dementia denial of the disease as it progressed. Charles himself initiated the visit to his primary care physician that resulted in his diagnosis. On his own, he had become increasingly aware of the insidious dementia signs and symptoms before I had even noticed them. At the doctor's appointment, my father was able to discuss with his physician how he was experiencing some sleep difficulties, slowed movements and slight tremors, as well as decline in his cognitive function and ability to process information that had always come so easily to him in the past. Sadly, it turned out to be early-stage Lewy body dementia. At that time, he accepted the doctor's verdict with poise. My father and I talked about it, researched it, and made plans together about what we would do. We decided to make the most of the time we had left before the disease started taking over his mind and abilities. By making accommodations for the short-term memory loss and other budding symptoms, we managed to enjoy a few years spending precious time and making special memories. Doing all those things we had put off before we received the dreadful diagnosis. The progression was mercifully slow, but painfully steady, especially at the beginning. But over time, the disease began to assume control of his life. His personality changed entirely. If I even brought up the idea of visiting a doctor for any reason, he would become furious. I did not understand what was happening, why my father was changing before my eyes. I had to accept the heart-wrenching reality that this was no longer the father I once knew. The ever-present smile and loving disposition was all but completely gone. The gentle, patient man who for 56 years had never had an ill-tempered word for me now frequently exploded with irrational angry outbursts and uncharacteristic fits of impatience. It was in the final part of his dementia journey that he became completely unaware of how debilitated he had become. He could no longer remember or process that he had been given the diagnosis early on, or that at one time he had even gracefully accepted the fact. At this point, he had full-blown dementia denial of his own illness. But this went beyond the normal type of denial so many people experience when facing difficult circumstances, such as the denial I had as a caregiver. Instead, my father had a different kind of denial known as anosognosia, literally a lack of knowledge of disease. I later learned that anosognosia has long been recognized in people with strokes, brain tumors, Alzheimer's, Lewy body, and Huntington's disease, as well as many of the other causes of dementia symptoms. Although this dementia denial may at first appear to be similar to the denial the caregiver is experiencing, anosognosia is not the same and is far more challenging. Unfortunately, there is no antidote for anosognosia, as there is no way to challenge it with dementia awareness. As his son, I was forced to watch my father fade away a piece at a time without having any way to stop it, change it, fix it, or console him by sharing what was happening. Any mention of dementia, Lewy body, the decline in his health and abilities, or his progressing care needs would send my father into a rage. There is nothing wrong with me! His resistance to my care efforts was nothing short of intense, often with a pinch of paranoia and a handful of spitefulness thrown into the mix. Any attempt on my part to make him understand that he had changed and needed to accept new limits was an exercise in frustration for both of us. It was simply much more successful if, as his primary caregiver, I made all decisions related to his care without discussing them with him or asking for his input or opinion. On a very basic level, I came to realize my father's thinker was broken and that the more I did the thinking for him, the kinder and more supportive I remained in his eyes. This all felt weird and crazy, and so contrary to how I had identified my part in this father-son relationship. Yet I found that when I changed my communication approach and shared less information concerning his condition and necessary care decisions, he appeared calmer and more at peace. When I finally recognized that he simply did not know what he did not know and I accepted that I must do all the knowing for him about his care, our dementia journey became less tumultuous and we were able to experience many more meaningful moments together. Lessons Learned In some cases, people with dementia will experience precisely the same kind of dementia denial their caregivers exhibit, namely that understandable emotional desire to convince ourselves that everything is fine. However, anosognosia is an entirely different problem. While anosognosia is still difficult to define, researchers know it results from physical, anatomical changes or damage to the part of the brain that affects perception of one's own illness. As a neurological impairment, it is common following brain injuries or diseases. For instance, people with a disease or illness causing dementia may display anosognosia and insist they do not have a problem. Naturally, the family member or professional caregiver who has to deal with this problem can become exasperated. To make the situation even more challenging, anosognosia may be complete or selective, in the latter case only revealing itself in certain situations that trigger the person's dementia denial, such as when he or she becomes frustrated trying to perform simple daily tasks. The person diagnosed with any form of dementia may be entirely unaware of his or her impairment or react with anger and defensiveness if confronted about the illness. This makes it difficult to diagnose anosognosia and tough to differentiate it from common dementia denial. But whether your loved one is in simple denial of his or her dementia or has anosognosia, the most effective caregiving strategy is one of acceptance and empathy toward the symptoms and subsequent behaviors, rather than endlessly trying and failing to make the person with dementia understand. Much more than denial, anosognosia is a far-reaching lack of awareness of impairment. Most people do not even know they are ill, and it affects up to 81% of people with Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of dementia. After strokes, some studies show up to 77% of people suffer anosognosia. And just like any and all causes and symptoms of dementia, this lack of awareness affects each person differently. Anosognosia with dementia shows no favoritism with regard to occupation, gender, ethnicity, education, or financial status, as evidenced in the life of President Woodrow Wilson and his personal dementia journey. In 1919, toward the end of his second term, President Wilson suffered a stroke. Following his stroke, the notable feature of the president's behavior was his denial of his incapacity. Denial of illness is a common sequel to the type of brain injury received by President Wilson. In this condition, the patient denies or appears unaware of such physical deficits as paralysis or blindness, as well as loss of other brain functions. To casual observers, anosognosic patients may appear normal and even bright and witty. When not talking about their disability, they can be quite rational, and tests of their intelligence may show no deficit. In President Wilson's case, his anosognosia prevented him from getting the care he needed after his stroke. Wilson described himself as lame and referred to his cane as his third leg, but otherwise he considered himself perfectly fit to be president. There was even talk of a third term. Yet his close associates noticed a change in his personality and abilities. He became increasingly suspicious, even paranoid, without having the dimmest awareness of the fact that he was perhaps becoming a different person from who he once was. Stockton Axon, his brother-in-law from his first marriage, wrote that President Wilson would be seized with what, to a normal person, would seem to be inexplicable outbursts of emotion. He was furious at anyone who suggested that he had physical and mental problems, and the last months of his presidency became a graveyard of fired associates. To explain this type of dementia denial another way, our right brain is wired to detect anomalies and new information and incorporate these into our sense of reality. According to neuroscientist Dr. V.S. Ramachandran in the New York Times, when something happens to damage that part of the brain, such as a stroke, Alzheimer's, or many of the other causes of dementia, then the left brain seeks to maintain continuity of belief using denial, rationalization, confabulation, and other tricks to keep one's mental model of the world intact. If you are concerned that your loved one, client, or resident might have dementia complicated by anosognosia, here are some signs to look for. Not keeping up with regular daily tasks or personal hygiene. Having difficulty managing money or bills. Being more spontaneous or less inhibited in conversation without concern for his or her own behavior. Becoming angry when confronted with forgetfulness, lack of self-care, poor decision-making, or many other dementia symptoms. Confabulating. Making up answers that the person believes are true, though sometimes the details may be imaginary, may pertain to something that happened in the past, or even be based on something he or she read or heard elsewhere. Perceptions and approaches. Dealing with dementia denial on the part of the person with dementia is a trying situation for caregivers who are endeavoring to help someone who essentially does not and cannot acknowledge he or she is ill. People with dementia and anosognosia exhibit obvious difficulties with routine tasks, judgment, and executive thinking skills. Yet they often insist they do not need help, even to the point of refusing medical evaluation or treatment, as well as much-needed non-medical assistance and emotional support. For caregivers, successfully overcoming dementia denial involves the ability to learn a new perception and deeper understanding of dementia, and then take that knowledge to develop a care approach that works. People with dementia and anosognosia, however, cannot become dementia-aware, as they will become progressively more incapable of recognizing they have any dementia symptoms, even when their symptoms are very obvious to those who are caring for them. Unlike with caregiver dementia denial, there is no remedy for the form of denial exhibited by someone with anosognosia. It is a scary thought to consider. What if you were ill, suffering from dementia, and did not know it, and there was no way to make you understand the complexity of it all? How would your loved ones or treatment providers give you appropriate care if you continued to refuse their well-intentioned and necessary help? This is precisely what many caregivers experience, as the person whom they are assisting continues to resist critical support on many different levels. This often leaves the caregiver with the responsibility of providing and accessing appropriate help. Having to make difficult decisions without the buy-in from the one who desperately needs increasing levels of care. For example, many anguished family caregivers have contacted me about how and when to take away the car keys, while their loved one with dementia is still certain he or she can safely operate an automobile. Another common question concerns when it is time to access out-of-home care. People with dementia and anosognosia will dig in their heels and wholly believe they can stay independent in their own homes and safely care for themselves, even when all the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. Answering these questions and determining the right time can be excruciating for the primary caregiver and is another reason why dementia care is such a stressful role. In these situations, you, the caregiver, must cease basing essential care decisions on what you believe your loved one wants. Instead, you must move to the logical response of decisions based on what he or she needs at the time, accessing the care and assistance that will keep your loved one and everyone around your loved one safe. Going against your loved one's wishes is seldom the path of least resistance. On the contrary, it is almost always the path of greatest opposition. And it is an exhausting uphill segment of the dementia journey. But if your loved one has both dementia and dementia denial, especially denial in the form of anosognosia, it is essential that you take charge of his or her affairs. Here are five things to keep in mind when caring for someone with dementia symptoms and anosognosia. 1. Use positive action statements in your communication. Be gentle, encouraging, and empathetic about necessary tasks. Avoid asking too many questions or giving too many options. Questions can be distressing at the best of times and can put pressure on people. Questions, reasoning, and multiple options become too much information for the person with dementia to process. Keep it simple. 2. Spend time with no pressure, no agenda, no judgment, and no expectations. Allow the person to be whoever he or she is right now. Downsize any responsibilities that are unnecessary. Often the answer is a professional in-home caregiver, adult daycare, or a memory care community that is trained in dementia care. It takes a village to care for someone with dementia. So build your village of care professionals, family, friends, and local community members. Remember, you cannot stop, change, or cure the dementia symptoms. You can only help to manage them. 3. Avoid fact- and reason-based discussions with the person who has dementia symptoms and anesthesia about his or her medical condition or changing care needs. The more you, the caregiver, become dementia-aware, the more you will see that your loved one's comments, behaviors, and changes are an expected part of the disease process and out of his or her control, helping you to better plan and accept what is yet to come. When voicing concerns, stay calm, confident, patient, and present in the moment. Articulate your thoughts in a simple and positive light. Practice communication that excludes discussion about what abilities he or she has lost, all the while increasing the focus and attention on what abilities still remain. 4. Allow people with dementia the dignity of experiencing whatever emotions they are feeling at the time, with an understanding that these feelings are real to them, even if they are difficult for you to understand. Although people with dementia may seem distant or confused at times, their emotions and feelings remain. When interacting with people who have dementia, hold their hands, give them a hug, show them patience, compassion, and care. Attempting to correct or reason with a person who has anesthesia will only result in resistance. A test of frustration for both of you that can generate further feelings of anxiety, even accelerating to more extreme challenging behaviors, such as combativeness and aggression. 5. Be sure you remember to take care of yourself. Caregivers often feel obligated to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the person for whom they are caring. As a result of neglecting to care for themselves, caregivers frequently become burned out and resentful, especially if other family members do not share the burden. Holding regular family meetings and keeping open communication can help clear the air before things reach a breaking point. It is essential to everyone's well-being that you remain in good health and can balance your care responsibilities with your own needs. As you continue to listen to this book, you will become more and more dementia-aware, helping to sustain you through the many obstacles you will encounter on the road ahead. Whether you are a family caregiver, a professional caregiver, or an individual who wishes to help build a more dementia-aware world, keep in mind that the more you know about the many layers of dementia, the better you will be able not only to navigate your own dementia care journey, but to help others on their personal journeys as well.
