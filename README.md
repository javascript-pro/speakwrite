## ✨ What It Does

From a single audio clip (voice note or podcast segment), SpeakWrite:

1. Transcribes speech using AI (OpenAI Whisper)
2. Lets you edit the transcript for prompt precision
3. Lets you add campaign context (e.g. target URL)
4. Generates a full markdown file with:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Twitter (X) post
   - Facebook/LinkedIn Open Graph fields
5. Creates a DALL·E generated image based on the message
6. Zips all assets, downloads them, and stores them to Firebase
